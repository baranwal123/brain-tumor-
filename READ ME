The early & accurate identification and timely detection of brain tumors are critical for effective medical intervention and patient.

Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on invasive procedures such as biopsies or expensive imaging techniques, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation. 
Machine learning (ML) offers a promising avenue to improve the efficiency and accuracy of brain tumor detection by analyzing medical imaging data.. 
objectives:
Develop machine learning algorithms to find brain tumors from brain scans.
Make sure these algorithms work fast and accurately, so doctors can use them to help patients quickly
Collects data from MRI and CT images for  tumor model.
Uses feature extraction techniques like convolutional neural networks for accurate classification.
  Test & Train the algorithms to make sure they can find different kinds of brain    tumors in different people.
Continuous modeling and iterations improve accuracy and reliability.

Implementation Results:


In this we used CNN  : Sequential Model
Dataset : Total No. of MRI images = 3060
	         where image containing brain tumor = 1500
	         & image doesnâ€™t have = 1500
	         for the prediction =60
Gained Accuracy :  97.16 %
